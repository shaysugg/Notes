- TDD is about writing tests before writing app logic.
- Use logical statements to drive what you test.
- Each test should fail upon its first execution. Not compiling counts as a failure.
- Use tests to guide refactoring code for readability and performance.
- Good naming conventions make it easier to navigate and find issues.
- We can add test failure breakpoint in order to halt the execution and be able to debug whenever a test fails
