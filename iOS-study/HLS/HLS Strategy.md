1. **Fetch the Master Playlist**:
   - The client-side player should fetch the master playlist file (usually named `master.m3u8`) from the server.
   - This file contains information about the available bitrate variants, including their URLs, codecs, and other relevant metadata.

2. **Parse the Master Playlist**:
   - The client-side player should parse the master playlist file to extract the details of the available bitrate variants.
   - This includes the URLs of the corresponding media playlist files for each variant.

3. **Evaluate Device Capabilities**:
   - The client-side player should evaluate the device's capabilities, such as the available CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
   - This information will be used to determine the most suitable bitrate variant to start playback.

4. **Select the Initial Bitrate Variant**:
   - Based on the device capabilities and the information from the master playlist, the client-side player should select the most appropriate bitrate variant to start playback.
   - This initial selection should balance video quality and network constraints.

5. **Fetch the Media Playlist**:
   - The client-side player should fetch the media playlist file (usually named `variant.m3u8`) for the selected bitrate variant.
   - This file contains the URLs of the individual video and audio segment files.

6. **Parse the Media Playlist**:
   - The client-side player should parse the media playlist file to extract the URLs of the segment files.
   - This information will be used to download and play the segments in the correct sequence.

7. **Download and Play Segments**:
   - The client-side player should start downloading and playing the individual segment files in the order specified by the media playlist.
   - As the playback progresses, the player should continuously monitor the network conditions and device performance.

8. **Adaptive Bitrate Switching**:
   - Based on the monitored network conditions and device performance, the client-side player should dynamically switch between different bitrate variants to provide the best possible viewing experience.
   - This may involve fetching a new media playlist, downloading the appropriate segment files, and seamlessly transitioning the playback.

9. **Buffering and Playback Control**:
   - The client-side player should implement buffering mechanisms to ensure a smooth playback experience, even in the face of network fluctuations.
   - It should also provide playback controls, such as play, pause, seek, and volume adjustment, to the user.

10. **Error Handling and Fallback**:
    - The client-side player should be able to handle various errors that may occur during the streaming process, such as network errors, unsupported codecs, or playlist parsing issues.
    - It should have appropriate fallback mechanisms to provide a graceful user experience in case of errors.
