### Strategy
1. **Fetch the M3U8 File**:
    
    - The client-side player should fetch the M3U8 file (either the master playlist or the media playlist) from the server using an HTTP request.
2. **Parse the M3U8 File Content**:
    
    - The client-side player should parse the content of the M3U8 file, which is a plain-text file with a specific format.
    - The M3U8 file follows the Extended M3U (M3U8) playlist format, which is a variant of the M3U playlist format.
3. **Identify the Playlist Type**:
    
    - The first line of the M3U8 file should start with `#EXTM3U`, which indicates that it's an M3U8 playlist.
    - The client-side player should determine whether the playlist is a master playlist or a media playlist based on the content of the file.
4. **Parse the Playlist Entries**:
    
    - For a master playlist, the client-side player should parse the `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF` tags, which provide information about the available bitrate variants, such as the URL, codec, resolution, and bitrate.
    - For a media playlist, the client-side player should parse the `#EXTINF` tags, which provide information about the individual segment files, including their duration and URL.
5. **Extract Relevant Information**:
    
    - From the parsed playlist entries, the client-side player should extract the necessary information, such as:
        - For master playlists: the URLs of the media playlist files for each bitrate variant.
        - For media playlists: the URLs of the individual segment files.
6. **Handle Playlist Tags and Attributes**:
    
    - The client-side player should be able to handle various M3U8 tags and attributes, such as `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION`, `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE`, `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`, and others, which provide additional information about the playlist and the segments.
7. **Error Handling**:
    
    - The client-side player should be able to handle any errors or unexpected formats in the M3U8 file, and provide appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms.
