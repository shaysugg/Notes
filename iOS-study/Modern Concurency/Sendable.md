## Sendable
in the swift concurrency topics it means: **safe to use in concurrent code**
* there is a Sendable protocols that some classes conforms to: like **Actors**
* there is an annotation `@Sendable` which makes closure sendable
```swift
@escaping @Sendable () async -> Void
```

* Task creation takes a `@Sendebale` closure
* In the sendable closures the values we capture should be without possibility of mutation. like value types, actors, classes that implement their own synchronizations.

ðŸ”¥ The best practice in your own code is to require that any **closures** you run **asynchronously** be `@Sendable`, and that any **values** you use in **asynchronous** code adhere to the `Sendable` protocol.
