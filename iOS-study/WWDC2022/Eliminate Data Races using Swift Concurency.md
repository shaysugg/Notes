For better understanding between sharing data between different tasks let see this example:
* assume each **task** represented as **boat**
* and each **data** items in it represent as an **object**
* If two **boat (task)** meet and want to **share** items (data), we should be sure that data is about to share is safe to mutate from two different boats (tasks). 
* So programmatically **Value Types** like Structs and Enums are safe to share (new copy of them would be created and shared) but **Reference Types** like classes are not (because reference of them get shared). 
* Being safe to share between two tasks means conforming to **Sendable Protocol** and all data that get share between two tasks should conform to it.

For better understanding standing of isolate classes that multiple tasks can safely mutate it lets see this example

* Assume each **actor** represented as an **island**
* and again each **task** represented as a **boat**
* Island can have some items (data) and it can mutate them only from inside of itself (by a function)
* So the island(actor) can get shared and different boat(tasks) can mutate items(data) of island(actor) (using internal mutating function that island has)
* Accessing to actor always should await, because some other task may mutating it at the same time
* Non-Sendable data cannot share between a task and an actor.
