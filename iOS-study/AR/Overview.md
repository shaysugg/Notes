## ARKit
* Depth API:
	Realistic object occlusion by enabling instant placement of virtual objects and blending them seamlessly with their physical surrounding
* Scene Geometry:
	Topological map of your space with labels identifying floors, walls, ceilings, windows, doors, and seats.
* Instant AR:
* People Occlusion: 
	AR content realistically passes behind and in front of people in the real world
* Motion Capture:
	* Capture the motion of a person
	* Height estimation
## RealityKit
> RealityKit is a higher-level framework built on top of ARKit that allows developers to create more complex and interactive 3D experiences with less code.

* Custom shaders:
	Seamlessly blends virtual content with the real world
* Dynamic assets:
	Programmatically changing an image or mesh with every frame.
* Character Controller
* Custom systems:
	Custom Entity Component System for organizing the assets(?)
* Scalable performance:
	Utilizing the latest Metal features to get the most out of the GPU.
* Object occulusion:
	LiDAR Scanner and edge detection allow objects to interact with their surroundings.
* Shared AR experiences
## Room Plan
> Powered by ARKit, RoomPlan is an API that utilizes the camera and LiDAR Scanner on iPhone and iPad to create a 3D floor plan of a room, including key characteristics such as dimensions and types ofÂ furniture.

## AR Creation Tools
* Reality Composer:
	build, test, tune, and simulate AR experiences for iPhone or iPad.
* Reality Converter: 
	convert to USDZ from other 3D formats
## Quick Look
Embed quick look in the apps and let users see USDZ files of virtual objects in 3D or AR on iPhone and iPad.
