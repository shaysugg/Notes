## Pointer vs. reference
theyâ€™re similar in concept, but a reference is more abstract and many of its operations is handled by standard library.
## Memory layout
3 basic concepts of memory layouting:
- **Size**: This refers to the number of bytes it takes to store a value of this type. A size of four means this type requires four bytes of storage.
- **Alignment**: For a simple explanation, the address must be divisible by the alignment value. A value of two means this type canâ€™t be stored on a pointer of odd value. Youâ€™ll learn more about this shortly.
- **Stride**: This refers to how many bytes to increment on your pointer to read the next object.
We can get memory layout information of a type like this:
```Swift
MemoryLayout<Int>.size // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<Int>.alignment // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<Int>.stride // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
```
### Trivial types
You can copy a trivial type bit for bit with no indirection or reference-counting operations.
`Int`, `Float`, `Double` and `Bool` are all trivial types. `Structs` or `enums` that contain those value types and donâ€™t contain any reference types are also considered trivial types.
let's see how memory layout gonna be for this example
```Swift
struct IntBoolStruct {
  var intValue: Int
  var boolValue: Bool
}

MemoryLayout<IntBoolStruct>.size // returns 9
MemoryLayout<IntBoolStruct>.alignment // returns 8
MemoryLayout<IntBoolStruct>.stride // returns 16
```

For the alignment, it makes sense that it is 8 to ensure that intValue is not misaligned. As for stride, it has a value of 16 to maintain the alignment and to reserve enough space for the struct. It canâ€™t be 9, nor can it be 8.

now lets see memory layout of this example (only order of properties have changed)
```Swift
struct BoolIntStruct {
  var boolValue: Bool
  var intValue: Int
}

MemoryLayout<BoolIntStruct>.size // returns 16 ðŸ¤”
MemoryLayout<BoolIntStruct>.alignment // returns 8
MemoryLayout<BoolIntStruct>.stride // returns 16
```
**For the struct to be aligned, all the properties inside it must also be aligned.** To have the boolean property stored before the integer, this means that a seven-bit padding is required right after the boolean to allow the integer to be properly aligned. This causes the padding to be considered in the size of the struct directly.

### Reference types
When you have a pointer of such a type, youâ€™re pointing to a **reference** of that value and not the value itself.
``` Swift
class IntBoolClass {
  var intValue: Int = 0
  var boolValue: Bool = false
}

MemoryLayout<IntBoolClass>.size // returns 8
MemoryLayout<IntBoolClass>.alignment // returns 8
MemoryLayout<IntBoolClass>.stride // returns 8

class EmptyClass {}

MemoryLayout<EmptyClass>.size // returns 8
MemoryLayout<EmptyClass>.alignment // returns 8
MemoryLayout<EmptyClass>.stride // returns 8
```
## Pointer types
* `UnsafeRawPointer` : basic raw pointer that doesnâ€™t know any information of the type. (canâ€™t work on reference or non-trivial)
* `UnsafePointer<Type>` : this one knows the type of the object that it points.
these are the pointers when you want to work with arrays
* `UnsafeRawBufferPointer`
* `UnsafeBufferPointer<Type>`
all of the above pointers are read-only. the read-and-write form of them are:
â€¢ `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`
â€¢ `UnsafeMutablePointer<Type>`
â€¢ `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer`
â€¢ `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Type>`
