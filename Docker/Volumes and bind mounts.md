Here's a concise comparison of Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts:

Volumes:
- Managed entirely by Docker
- Stored in Docker's storage area
- Easier to backup and migrate
- Recommended for most use cases

Example commands:
```bash
# Create a volume
docker volume create my_volume

# Run container with volume
docker run -v my_volume:/app/data image_name

# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect a volume
docker volume inspect my_volume
```

Bind Mounts:
- Directly map a host filesystem path to a container path
- More direct control over exact filesystem location
- Less portable across different systems

Example commands:
```bash
# Run container with bind mount
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path image_name

# Example for development
docker run -v $(pwd):/app nodejs_project
```

Key Differences:
- Volumes are Docker-managed
- Bind mounts use host's exact filesystem path
- Volumes have better performance and portability
- Bind mounts provide direct host system access

Recommendation: Use volumes for most scenarios, especially in production.
