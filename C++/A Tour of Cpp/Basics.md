## Functions
Overloading: It's possible to define functions with different parameters
```cpp
void print(int);
void print(double);
```
A function that is member of a class would be called like
```cpp
void ClassName::funcName();
```
## auto
`auto` is being used when type can deduced from the initializer
## Scopes
local scope: functions and lambda
class scope: a member of a class scope of a class
