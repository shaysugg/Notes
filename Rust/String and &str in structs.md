1. **Use `&str` when:**
    - The string data is owned by an external source (e.g., a function parameter or a global variable) and you don't need to own the data.
    - The string data has a longer lifetime than the struct instance, and you can ensure that the data will be valid for the lifetime of the struct.
    - You want to avoid the overhead of allocating and managing memory for the string data.
2. **Use `String` when:**
    - The string data is owned by the struct and its lifetime is tied to the struct instance.
    - You need to modify or mutate the string data within the struct.
    - The string data's lifetime is not guaranteed to be longer than the struct instance, and you need to own the data to ensure its validity.
